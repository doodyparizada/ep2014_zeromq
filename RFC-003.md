# Hide and seek


Hider: A hider peer listenes on a specific port and awaits incoming "guess" requests.

Seeker: A seeker peer connects to a known hider peer (which can be found using the protocol defined in RFC-002).

When the seeker peer connects to a hider peer it sends a single string message representing the guessed city name.

The hider peer in turn answers with either a "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT" string message depending on if the guessed city name was in the hider's list of cities or not.
